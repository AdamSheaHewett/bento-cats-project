## Get a load of these cats!

This app was created as part of the interview process for Bento for Business. 

Download/clone this repo, run `npm install`, then `npm start` and open http://localhost:3000/ to see those cats in action!

Upon loading, the app calls two APIs - one for cat images, one for cat facts - and displays the results in cards. Here's a breakdown of the features:

### Favorite your favorite cats
Enjoy a particular cat image or find an interesting fact? Favorite that kitty! Then click the "Show only favorited cats." button at the top of the page to see only your favorite cats. Click it again to see all the cats, and choose some more favorites.

### Sort alphabetically
Why sort by the first word in the fact, when you can sort by the first letter of the last word? Click the "Sort by last word in fact." button to sort all the cats. We like order so no unsorting, sorry.

### Show only one cat
Tired of too many cats on your screen? (Who would be?) Click the "Show only one cat." button to show just one kitty. Click it again to bring the rest of them back - that's better. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and styled with [Bulma](http://bulma.io/).
