This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and styled with [Bulma](http://bulma.io/).

This app was created for Bento for Business as part of their interview process. Upon loading, the app calls two APIs - one for cat images, one for cat facts - and displays the results in cards in a column. The three buttons at the top of the app provide different changes to the organization of the cards in the column. The "Sort by last word in fact." sorts the cards alphabetically by the last word in the fact. The other two buttons are still in development.

You can download this repo, run `npm install` and `npm start` and open http://localhost:3000/ to see the app in action!
